Sharetrace is a financial modelling tool which provides users with reliable, current, and accurate information about NASDAQ stocks. This tool helps any analyst evaluate information of a company that is publicly-traded in the nasdaq by organizing the information neatly into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for further analysis. Sharetrace bridges the gap between organization and accurate financial modelling.
